      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Jori Lehtinen, a fresh full-stack web developer from Finland. I
        focus on building edge and browser-based applications that prioritize
        low latency, security, and global reach — with minimal cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can help your team deploy secure APIs and responsive frontends
        worldwide using the Cloudflare developer platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience includes Cloudflare Workers, HTTP REST APIs, D1 databases,
        KV caching, secret management, and streaming — as well as tools like
        Resend and major cloud providers. I’ve worked with Google Cloud (Edge
        Functions, Maps API, Cloud Storage, OAuth client apps) and Azure
        (Functions, Communication Services, OAuth client apps).
      </p>
      <p>
        My ambition is to master web development across design, infrastructure,
        and code. I continually improve my skills through independent learning.
        Next on my roadmap is exploring browser and edge APIs like
        AudioWorklets, CSS Worklets, OffscreenCanvas, MutationObserver, Proxies,
        and WebSockets — and later, WebAssembly using Rust.
